# clusproducts

We've used KMeans Clustering first and divided into 8 clusters

Then Performed Hierachial Clustering to obtain a dendrogram followed by standardisation to reduce/stamdardise the errror to increase the performance.

Again performed KMEans clustring and found new standardised data

Also done tSNE clustering.
